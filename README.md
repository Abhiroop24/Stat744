[*The image*](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KHuzoplbxWrxLPcGdmdY5FRG-bfzZxSs/view?usp=sharing) is an example of a **terrible** data visualization that I found on the web. It is not exactly ugly or wrong, but it is bad (especially, misleading). The Y-axis, which represents the number of guns per adult in the US starts from 0.90, and not from 0. So, to an untrained eye, at the first glance, it seems that the average gun ownership has doubled in the year 2012 from 1994 whereas in reality, it has increased by only 10%. Hence, in most cases it is a good idea to start the Y-axis from the base point in case of bar charts, otherwise, the illustration may be deceptive.

JD: It also has other issues; it's not really beautiful, nor efficient at conveying information. Thanks. Grade 2/3
